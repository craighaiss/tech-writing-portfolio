## Reading error codes with an OBD-II scan tool

This topic outlines the steps you take to read OBD-II messages stored in your vehicle's computer. This will allow you to view error codes related to the status lights on your vehicle's dashboard. You will need a scan tool that supports the OBD-II standard to complete this procedure.

1. Locate the OBD-II port on your vehicle. In most vehicles, the port is located near the bottom of the dashboard, underneath the steering wheel.

2. Make sure your vehicle's engine is turned off.

3. Plug the connector on your OBD-II scan tool into the port on your vehicle.

4. If your OBD-II scan tool has a `Power` button, press it now.

5. Turn the key in the ignition to the `On` position. The display on your OBD-II scan tool should now be active.

6. Press the `Scan` button on your OBD-II scan tool. The tool will begin to scan your vehicle's computer system, and will notify you when the scan is complete.

7. After the scan is complete, use the arrow buttons on your scan tool to choose `Error codes` and then press `Ok`. The scan tool will display a list of any error codes found during the scan.

8. Record any error codes, so you can look them up on the vehicle manufacturer's website or share them with a certified repair technician. The codes for each manufacturer are unique, and do not apply to vehicles from other manufacturers.

    {% include note.html content="Your vehicle's computer will continue to store error codes until they are manually erased using an OBD-II scan tool. Disconnecting the vehicle's battery for an extended period of time will also clear any stored codes and reset the vehicle's computer. We recommend that you only clear error codes for issues that have been repaired." %}
