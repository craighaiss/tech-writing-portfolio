summary: Introduces the technical writing samples contained in this site

As a Senior Technical Writer / Tech Lead for the software industry, I have been writing documentation for external customers and internal employees for many years. However, the proprietary nature of my work has left me with few samples to share. Also, I'm a team player, and many of the documents I've worked on were collaborations with other writers. While those documents reflect many hours of research, writing, and plain hard work, I do not feel comfortable taking credit for the work of an entire team of amazing writers.

This portfolio is an attempt to share writing samples that are my own. Any mistakes can be fully attributed to me.

Please use the navigation on the left to view various samples of my writing. Some of them are the results of frustration, as I struggled with tasks that were either poorly documented or completely undocumented. Others are the results of converting conversations or non-professional video recordings into clear instructions, similar to how information is gathered from Subject-Matter Experts (SMEs).

If you have questions regarding any of these samples, please contact me via the Feedback link in the page header.

This portfolio was generated using a [docs-as-code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/) approach. The content is written in Markdown using VS Code, and changes are tracked in Git. The output is generated using Jekyll and a slightly-modified version of Tom Johnson's excellent [Documentation Theme for Jekyll](https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/).

Thank you for taking the time to consider my work. I really appreciate it!
